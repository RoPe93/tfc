Project Description:
--------------------

Tinfoil Chat (TFC) is a high assurance encryption plugin for Pidgin IM client that combines free and open source hardware and software. Secure by design implementation provides a no-compromise layer over the standard and OTR encrypted communication, that addresses automatable attacks used by intelligence agencies for mass surveillance:

1. Information theoretically secure encryption and authentication guarantee privacy and integrity of communication.

2. Hardware random number generator provides truly random and properly whitened entropy for one-time keys.

3. Data diodes provide hardware enforced unidirectional gateways that prevent exfiltration (theft) of plaintexts and encryption keys.
